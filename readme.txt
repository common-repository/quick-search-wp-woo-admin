== Description ==

Quick Search WP & Woo-Admin was built to reduce the number of clicks it takes to do a search in the Wordpress Admin area. Regardless of what you're searching, you can do this search from any page in the Admin area by hovering over the "Quick Search" menu item and typing your search query in the field of the post type you want to search.

This plugin allows you to quick search:
 - Posts
 - Pages
 - Users
 - WooCommerce Orders
 - WooCommerce Products
 - Recipes (from the WP Ultimate Recipe Plugin)

This plugin is compatible with WooCommerce.
